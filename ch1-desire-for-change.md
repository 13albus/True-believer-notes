It is a truism that many who join a rising revolutionary movement are attracted by the prospect of
sudden and spectacular change in their conditions of life

History seems to suggest that nationalist fervor must be tapped if the drastic changes projected and
initiated by revolutionary enthusiasm are to be consummated.

Hence it is that people with a sense of fulfillment think it a good world and would like to conserve
it as it is, while the frustrated favor radical change.

"If anything ail a man," says Thoreau, "so that he does not perform his functions, if he have a pain
in his bowels even ... he forthwith sets about reforming-the world.'"

Discontent by itself does not invariably create a desire for change. Other factors have to be present
like sense of power. For example, Fisherfolk, nomads and farmers who have to contend with the willful
elements, the creative worker who depends on inspiration, the savage awed by his surroundings they
all fear change.

Mostly when we are discontent with our situation we create a routine and thereby tries to get
comfortable around the discontent rather seek change because inherently we think we dont have the
power to change

Don't think if you are in a position of power then you will seek change if you are discontent.

The powerful can be as timid as the weak.

What seems to count more than possession of instruments of power is faith in the future. Where power
is not joined with faith in the future, it is used mainly to ward off the new and preserve the status
quo. On the other hand, extravagant hope, even when not backed by actual power, is likely to generate
a most reckless daring.
